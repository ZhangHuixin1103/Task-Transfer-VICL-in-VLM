# Unlocking the Boundaries of Cross-Task Visual In-Context Learning via Implicit Text-Driven VLMs
## 📌 Project Overview
This project introduces T2T-VICL, a collaborative pipeline designed to explore cross-task visual in-context learning (VICL). Unlike traditional single-task approaches, our focus is on transfer across heterogeneous low-level vision tasks — asking whether VLMs (Vision-Language Models) can still enable VICL when the visual prompt and target images come from different tasks. We design a mechanism for generating and selecting implicit text prompts, construct the first cross-task VICL dataset, and propose a training strategy to transfer knowledge from large VLMs to lightweight sVLMs, followed by a deployment framework from sVLM back to large models.

## 🚀 Key Contributions
**Cross-task VICL dataset:** The first dataset with implicit text descriptions for visual tasks, enabling systematic exploration of task boundaries.

**VLM↔sVLM framework:** A bidirectional pipeline for knowledge transfer and prompt generation between large-scale and compact models.

**Inference & evaluation scheme:** An automatic framework combining GRAINS, VIE score, and image quality assessment metrics to perform cross-task VICL without additional training or fine-tuning.

Our results show that T2T-VICL achieves stable performance across diverse low-level task pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of cross-task VICL within VLMs and highlighting its potential as a cost-effective paradigm for generalizable vision-language reasoning.
